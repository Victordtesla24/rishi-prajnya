## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails with "Module not found"

**Solution**: 
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Vercel installs dependencies from scratch, so local symlinks don't matter
- Ensure `yarn.lock` is committed to repository

### Issue 2: 404 Error on Deployment

**Solution**:
- Verify **Root Directory** is set to `./` (root)
- Do NOT point to `nextjs_space` subdirectory
- Check that `app` directory is at repository root

### Issue 3: Environment Variables Not Working

**Solution**:
- Ensure variables are added in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Redeploy after adding variables (existing deployments don't auto-update)
- For client-side access, prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

### Issue 4: Build Timeout

**Solution**:
- Default timeout is 10 minutes on Free tier
- Optimize build by removing unused dependencies
- Consider upgrading to Pro tier for longer timeouts
